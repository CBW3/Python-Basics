# Python-Basics
I answer about ~150 unique questions pertaining to Python functions, libraries, and syntax. 

Each situation or task requires basic, intermediate, or advanced knowledge pertaining to 
Python functions, libraries, and syntax. 

I developed this Jupyter Notebook as part of my training during the Google Adanved Data Analytics Professional Certification program. 

I also include some basic notes that I can refer to if I ever get stuck in my Python coding journey moving forwards.
